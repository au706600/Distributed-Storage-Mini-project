Erasure coding works by splitting a unit of data, such as file or object, into multiple  fragments, or data blocks, and then creating additional fragments or parity blocks. 
That can be used for data recovery. 

For each parity fragment, the erasure coding algorithm calculates the parity's value based on the original data fragments. 
The data and parity fragments are stored across multiple drives to protect against data loss in case a drive fails or data becomes corrupted on one of the drives.
