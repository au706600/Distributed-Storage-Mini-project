Erasure coding works by splitting a unit of data, such as file or object, into multiple  fragments, or data blocks, and then creating additional fragments or parity blocks. 
That can be used for data recovery. 

For each parity fragment, the erasure coding algorithm calculates the parity's value based on the original data fragments. 
The data and parity fragments are stored across multiple drives to protect against data loss in case a drive fails or data becomes corrupted on one of the drives. 
If such an event occurs, the parity fragments can be used to rebuild the data unit without experiencing data loss. 
For example, a storage system might use a 5+2 encoding configuration to distribute data across multiple physical drives. 
In this configuration, the EC algorithm breaks each data unit into five data fragments and then adds two parity fragments, which are calculated from the original data. 
Each fragment is stored on a different physical drive. As a result, the storage system must include at least seven drives.
